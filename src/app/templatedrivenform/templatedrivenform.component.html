        <!--  Valid: A form control or form group is considered valid if it meets all the validation criteria defined for it. For example, if a required field is filled out and other validation conditions are satisfied, the control is marked as valid.
        Invalid: Conversely, a form control or form group is considered invalid if it fails any of the validation criteria. If the user input doesn't meet the specified conditions (e.g., a required field is left blank), the control is marked as invalid.
        Touched: A form control is considered touched if the user has interacted with it. Interaction includes focusing on the control, typing in it, and then moving away from it. It's a way to track whether the user has interacted with a particular field.
        Untouched: On the other hand, a form control is considered untouched if the user has not interacted with it. It remains in the untouched state until the user focuses on it and interacts with it.
        Pristine: A form control or form group is considered pristine if it hasn't been changed from its initial state. In other words, the user hasn't modified the value or interacted with the control. Once the user modifies the value, the control becomes dirty. -->
